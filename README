Kharon

Kharon is a simple and lightweight Perl RPC library that provides
tight integration with KNC as well as UNIX domain sockets and forked
programs. It provides an OO model which can be conceptualised as
remotely calling an object. It is mainly intended at the moment
for relatively small client/server applications written to automate
basic procedures. It is used as the basis of the OSKT Kerberos
administrative tools krb5_admin and krb5_keytab.

It provides:

   1.  automatic failover,

   2.  server side redirection,

   3.  marshalling and unmarshalling of relatively complex Perl
       data structures containing an arbitrarily nested list of
       scalars, undef, array refs and hash refs, and

   4.  exception propagation.
